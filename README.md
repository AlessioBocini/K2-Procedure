# K2 Algorithm

This document presents an implementation of the K2 procedure for learning Bayesian network structures, as required for the Artificial Intelligence course. The algorithm follows the assumptions and structure proposed by Cooper and Herskovits, including the original scoring function. The implementation is demonstrated using a Python-based approach and evaluated on a sample dataset.
